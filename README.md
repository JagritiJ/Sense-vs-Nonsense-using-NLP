# Sense-vs-Nonsense-using-NLP
Sentence Classification using NLP


Problem Description
Commonsense knowledge and commonsense reasoning play a vital role in all aspects of
machine intelligence. In the NLP community, many benchmark datasets and tasks have been
created to address commonsense reasoning for language understanding. These tasks are
designed to assess machinesâ€™ ability to acquire and learn commonsense knowledge in order to
reason and understand natural language text (Storks et al. 2019).
The objective of this project is to directly test whether a system can differentiate natural
language statements that make sense from those that do not make sense. Three subtasks were
designed by SemEval 2020.
